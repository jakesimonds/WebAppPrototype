Individual assignment

## basic idea

Begin with the authentication and blogging demo that we worked on in class and build on it with new functionality and design elements of your choosing.

## key elements

* Your application may be a prototype of your personal website/blog.
  It's not recommended that you stray too far from the basic functionality
  because this assignment is only a short-term experiment.
  That said, you're encouraged to be creative.
* **New functionality:** In addition to authentication and blogging, 
<<<<<<< HEAD
  you should have some other functionality that leverages your back end database
  and is not included in the "flaskr" demo.

  A minimum requirement is the blog functionality of the in-class demo.
  For full credit, you must build on the in-class demo somehow.
* **New design:** Your final submission should have your own unique 
  design elements.
  You should include some vanilla CSS that is nicely formatted for readability
  (recall that the CSS for the app we discussed in class was minified and not very readable).
* **Acknowledgement:** Regardless of the path you choose for this assignment, 
  you must clearly reference the resources that you used to create your app.

  That may include mdn, the books recommended for the course, github repos 
  from other projects, ChatGPT, or anything else that you found helpful.
  Acknowledgement and attribution are important elements of open source software development.
  "Copy and paste" that violates software licenses can have serious consequences
  that extend well beyond plagiarism in the real world, so be careful.

* **Documentation:** In the README.md for your app...
  * Provide all the instructions necessary for reproducibly running your app by 
  your instructors. 
  * List any new functional elements that you added and that build upon the
  in-class exercise and previous homeworks.
  * List any new design elements.
  * List the major challenge(s) that you encountered along the way and the approach
  that you took to resolve the challenge(s) (i.e., the lesson(s) learned).
